# Quantum-Information-and-Computation
some resource for quantum information learning and research

## General study for Beginners

1. [website of A. Harrow](https://web.mit.edu/aram/www/advice/quantum.html): 	Where can I learn about quantum information? A guide by a celebrated scholar majoring in theoretical aspects.

2. [website of X. Wu](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~xwu/mini_lib.html): A rather comprehensive library for quantum information spanning from algorithm to experiment.

3. CS basics [I](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/Self-learning-Computer-Science),[II](https://csdiy.wiki/en/): A hot self-learning guide for computer science, by my teaching assistant in ics course. II is more comprehensive than I.


## Commercial Concern
For its great application potentials in different areas such as simulation, chemistry and communication, quantum information is given more and more attention by business and startups. Here are some resources to keep track:

1. [wiki: list of quantum company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_involved_in_quantum_computing_or_communication): a sketch of quantum technology related companies.

2. [website of V.V.Albert](https://sites.google.com/site/victorvalbert/quantum-computing-companies?authuser=0): not accessible now.

3. [quantumchina(光子盒)](https://www.quantumchina.com/): a Chinese media platform which aims to report state of the art progress of quantum technolodge around the world. The reports keep update timely.
